  title: In favour of a multiplied self. Can empathy lead to personal behaviour change?
  abstract: Within the field of Personal Informatics much research pursues the design
    of applications for self-tracking to motivate behaviour change. Such tools usually
    follow an 'egocentric' approach where the user is expected to reflect on and change
    her behaviour by visualizing her own collected data. I suggest that a system where
    the data of a user is mapped into the wellbeing of an external entity or a community,
    with which the user establishes an affective bond, could lead to an alternative
    approach towards self-awareness, based on empathy and vicarious emotions such
    as altruism and compassion.

  title: Estimating Usage Can Reduce the Stress of Social Networking
  abstract: 'Social networks are increasingly popular and provide benefits such as
    easy peer group communication. However, there is evidence that they can have negative
    consequences, such as increased stress levels. For two weeks, we provided participants
    with an objective measure of their social network usage and also asked them for
    a daily estimate of their usage over the previous 24 hours. Although their social
    network usage did not significantly change, participants’ perception of this activity
    was transformed, with a reduction in perceived stress, an increase in satisfaction
    and more generally an increase in their perception of control over time. We demonstrate
    the potential of combining both estimates and objective measures of activity usage
    in personal informatics systems: it can result in a transformation of attitudes
    towards the activity and a reduction in the stress associated with it.'

  title: Take a stance! Designing for healthy consumption
  abstract: Personal informatics apps that promote healthy consumption share similar
    aims, but vary in the means they adopt to meet them. The adopted means reflect
    different stances. Stances are the positions that designers implicitly take on
    a range of issues, such as personal information, freedom of choice and responsibility.
    Judgments on values such as privacy, autonomy and accountability underlie these
    stances. We argue for the use of stances as a tool to design personal informatics
    apps for healthy consumption. Making stances explicit and exploring alternate
    stances can help designers and stakeholders analyze means and their consequences,
    and identify and explore alternative approaches. This can better align app’s approaches
    with users' values, improving ethical acceptability, adoption and long-term use.
    We examine a number of apps, identify the implicit stances they take, and propose
    next steps toward using stances as a design tool.

  title: Health and Wellness Self-Management for Older Adults
  abstract: This position paper describes our ongoing work in the design of health
    and wellness applications that support older adults in managing their wellbeing.
    Specifically, this involves older adults self-reporting on various aspects of
    their wellbeing and receiving feedback on such, to increase their awareness of
    their health and to support them in maintaining or returning to a healthy state
    of being. In designing this application, it was critical to involve older adults,
    to understand their attitudes towards wellness, as well as assessing the effectiveness
    of various types of input and feedback visualisations.

  title: Examining Obstacles to Sharing Fine-Grained Personal Activity Data
  abstract: Many personal informatics applications integrate social sharing of sensed
    activity data. Sharing can promote personal goals through social mechanisms such
    as encouragement and competition. However, fine-grained sharing can often allow
    people to infer the context of sensed activity. This can surface significant privacy
    concerns, as people may unintentionally disclose aspects of their everyday life
    unrelated to their motivations for sharing. We first discuss scenarios that motivate
    fine-grained sharing but are restricted by current all-or-nothing approaches.
    We then discuss our interests in exploring potential alternative approaches to
    sharing fine-grained personal activity data.

  title: A DIY Self-Experimentation Toolkit for Behavior Change
  abstract: Within personal informatics and Quantified Self (QS), great emphasis
    has been placed on creating the systems for gathering and visualizing data to
    support self-discovery. While this is a vital first step, a logical next step
    is the development of self-experimentation tools focused on not only tracking
    but also testing of alternative strategies for behavior change. Many behavior
    change technologies provide the 'solution' to a problem rather than give individuals
    the tools to self- experiment with alternative solutions; a tactic that fits particularly
    well with QS. In this paper, we will briefly describe the conceptual frameworks
    relevant to habit formation, particularly those that emphasize context, and then
    we describe the Game as Life, Life as Game (GaLLaG) system developed by Burleson
    et al. and how this tool along with other QS tools could be used as the starting
    point of a DIY self-experimentation toolkit.

  title: The Value of a Critical Approach to Personal Health Informatics
  abstract: 'Personal health informatics systems present data to encourage healthy
    decision-making through self- knowledge. However, some consequences of these personal
    health informatics systems have cast doubt on the ''quantified self'' movement:
    namely, difficulties with sustained engagement, concerns about whether these interfaces
    enable long-term behavior change, and narrowing the definition of ''healthiness''
    to easily quantifiable metrics. We propose three design strategies for personal
    health informatics and speculate on how they can begin to meet these concerns.
    We are exploring how a critical design approach can be used to shift the focus
    of personal informatics from quantifiable behavior change to changes in personal
    outlooks on health. In this workshop, we hope to discuss these strategies with
    other personal informatics researchers and work both to develop evaluation plans
    for critical informatics systems and to begin integrating critical design approaches
    into the design of conventional personal informatics systems.'

  title: 'Enabling Foresight and Reflection: Interactive Simulations to Support Behaviour
    Change'
  abstract: 'The domains of personal informatics and persuasive technology have largely
    focused on supporting self-reflection using previously collected data. In contrast,
    we argue for a different novel approach: projecting forwards by enabling foresight.
    By developing interactive simulations that can provide people with predictions
    on how their current or theoretical behaviour will impact their goals, we hope
    to encourage them to connect to the future. To study the usefulness of such foresight,
    we will develop and evaluate a multi-faceted system aimed at supporting sustainable
    lifestyles for urban inhabitants.'

  authors: Short and Long-Term Benefits of Reflective Technologies
  title: Artie Konrad, Steve Whittaker, Ellen Isaacs
  abstract: New reflective systems are making it increasingly easier to make rich
    records of everyday activities and later reflect on these records. While these
    systems and other reflective tools such as Facebook Timeline are becoming more
    popular, few systematic studies have investigated their effects. Our work uses
    a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods to demonstrate short and
    long-term well-being benefits of reflection and identifies two different mechanisms
    that mediate these benefits. We also describe new work visualizing emotional habits.
    Our findings have important therapeutic implications, and suggest that reflective
    systems support natural adaptive memory processes.

  title: 'Social Media as Personal Informatics: Empowerment through Self-Reflection'
  abstract: This paper examines personal informatics in the context of online news
    reading and social media. We use the user profiles (“media fingerprints”) of the
    online feature story service Scoopinion (www.scoopinion.org) as an empirical entry
    point to discussing how online behavioral tracking in new media can be used to
    empower users through self-reflection. We argue that there is potential to leverage
    the vast sets of data that online services collect and manage for the personal
    benefit of individuals who choose to engage with social media but often find it
    hard to follow and control what data about them are available and who has access
    to it.

  title: 'QS Spiral: Visualizing Periodic Quantified Self Data'
  abstract: In this paper we propose an interactive visualization technique QS Spiral
    that aims to capture the periodic properties of quantified self data and let the
    user explore those recurring patterns. The approach is based on time-series data
    visualized as a spiral structure. The interactivity includes the possibility of
    varying the time span and the time frame shown, allowing for different levels
    of detail and the discoverability of repetitive patterns in the data on multiple
    scales. We illustrate the capabilities of the visualization technique using two
    quantified self data sets involving self-tracking of geolocation and physical
    activity respectively.

  title: Visualizing the effect of actions in personal informatics systems
  abstract: In this paper we present Tracer, a system that tracks aspects of a user’s
    cognitive and affective processes, and behavior through their personal writing,
    social network website activity, browsing activity and physical activities. Tracer
    contains several data analysis tools. We focus here on one of its features, an
    Engagement Gauging Function that measures behavioral engagement. Tracer generates
    four types of visualizations, individual, group, generic and specific visualizations.
    Our future work will focus on how to effectively visualize the behavior and affect

  abstract: While decision making is a well-studied area in cognitive psychology,
    few quantitative tools exist to aid decision making, mitigate the array of biases
    present in humans, and improve calibration. We are developing such a system, Baloo,
    that assists users in quantifying and tracking their belief in factual propositions,
    with the goal of combining these propositions into successful plans. With Baloo,
    individuals and groups can easily assess the relationship between various beliefs,
    and improve their predictive accuracy over time. In this paper, we describe the
    design of Baloo.

  title: A Human-Centered Conceptual Model for Personal Health Informatics Data
  abstract: Personal informatics is defined as the activity where people collect
    and reflect on personal data to gain a better understanding of their own behavior.
    This paper examines personal informatics in the context of health activities and
    suggests a new conceptual model for self- tracking data through the lens of human-centered
    theory. In light of this suggested model, the paper concludes with a discussion
    of forthcoming challenges we will likely face as personal health informatics permeates
    everyday life and the effect that will have on our socio-cultural values.

  title: Personalized Tracking of Goals and Gains after Psychotherapy Using Behavioral
    Data
  abstract: 'A multitude of stimuli can trigger anxiety or fear. If anxiety becomes
    pronounced and begins to impinge on a person''s social functioning, psychologists
    speak of anxiety disorders. Most fears and anxieties are strongly tied to location:
    for example, fear of bridges, crowded places, or elevators. Even when fear is
    elicited by specific, animate stimuli such as dogs or spiders, there are often
    strong ties with certain locations (e.g. the dog park). As a consequence of this
    marked worry and anxiety, people with phobias often cease to approach these locations
    – they avoid them. Besides the tremendous deleterious impact on general wellbeing
    and personal life, the economic consequences of anxiety disorders also impacts
    society. Exposure therapy is the treatment of choice for anxiety disorders and
    involves deliberate, systematic confrontation of feared stimuli. Although highly
    effective, return of fear post-treatment remains a significant problem for many
    individuals. There is evidence to suggest that fears return due to a lack of regular
    self-exposure to feared situations. We outline a software tool that allows feared
    situations to be identified within psychotherapy sessions that can be later used
    to create dynamic “fear maps”. These maps update as patients systematically confront
    these locations. In addition, we outline how principles from gamification can
    be used to depict quantified gains, and performance generally. Our application
    collects GPS and self-report data collected by mobile phones. Tracking the location
    of patients allows i) identification of movement patterns and ii) tagging of user''s
    emotional ratings at specific locations. This information helps the users to better
    quantify and understand the extent of their avoidance behavior, their progress
    and achievements, and importantly, provides an individualized measure of relapse
    potential.'

  title: Visualizing Gulfs and Streaks - Peripheral Support for Goal-Setting & Habit-Forming
    in Personal Informatics
  abstract: Tools for systematically logging information about one's exercise, sleep,
    diet, and other activities are increasingly commonplace. In spite of this, tools
    and strategies for using this data to impact behavior and change habits are still
    nascent. We present some reflections on goal-tracking and discuss a few initial
    strategies for supporting goal-setting and habit-formation in a life-logging tool.
    Our current work focuses on understanding the value of lightweight manual data
    input and on helping users track goals by maintaining peripheral awareness of
    'streaks' and 'gulfs' in their data. We illustrate our thinking with examples
    from several initial sketches and prototypes.

  title: 'The Weight of Things Lost: Self-knowledge and Personal Informatics'
  abstract: 'As a technologist and designer, I''m interested in the overlap between
    personal informatics and modern subjectivity: in the stories we tell through,
    and because of, our devices-as-companions. Personal informatics allows us to understand
    information about ourselves but the path is not always a straightforward one where
    more knowledge leads to more insight. The process of acquiring that knowledge,
    and the personal transformations that come along with it, often combine to yield
    surprising insights. I performed a year-long auto-ethnographic project of weight-loss
    and self-transformation through personal informatics and I use that experience
    here to make two arguments: for more embodied and autoethnographic evaluations,
    and for expanding both design and evaluation criteria to include the rich and
    contradictory relationships with ourselves and our world that the use of personal
    informatics can generate.'

  title: 'Lifelogging: New Challenges for Information Visualization on Mobile Platforms'
  abstract: Lifelogging offers a lot of promise in the realm of self- monitoring
    and reflection. The advent of personal devices with the potential for supporting
    self-tracking, such as smartphones, has resulted in large amount and multi-faceted
    data being created. Meanwhile, the consumption of collected lifelog data takes
    place within a wider mobile environment. These diversifying devices opened up
    new challenges for designers to create rich interactive visualizations under such
    context. In this workshop paper, we introduce SenseSeer, a web-based lifelogging
    application that passively tracking individual daily experience through built-in
    sensors from users' smartphones. We present our approaches from the stage of data
    collection to visualization of personal lifelogs on different mobile platforms.
