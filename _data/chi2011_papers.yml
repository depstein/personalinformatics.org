  title: Mobile Device Application of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Techniques
  abstract: This paper explores the design and implementation of an anxiety management
    application for transmission on mobile devices. The application employs cognitive
    behavioral therapy (CBT) methodology and is designed for the 16 to 25 year old
    demographic. Normally used in face to face therapeutic interactions, the use of
    a mobile application is unique in that it supplies the patient with just in time
    access to the therapeutic techniques necessary to manage their condition. We plan
    to evaluate the efficacy of this the application in real world deployment to a
    statistically significant user population.

  title: 'Interpersonal Informatics: understanding ourselves through our communities'
  abstract: Recent research in social network science has found that that what we
    do and say flows through our social network, impacting our friends, our friends’
    friends, and beyond. Conversely, our own personal choices are also the influenced
    by the social networks we participate in. We introduce the area of interpersonal
    informatics, a class of tools that allows groups of people to collect, aggregate,
    analyze, and share personally relevant information. The goal of interpersonal
    informatics is to help people gain awareness of how those around them affect their
    habits, beliefs, and health.

  title: 'Lost in Translation: Three challenges for the collection and use of data
    in personal informatics'
  abstract: 'As personal informatics tools grow in number, interpretation and interoperability
    of data will become increasingly important. In this paper, we share insights from
    our development of Estrellita, a medical tracking system for high-risk infants,
    and our ongoing research in the area of social media. We highlight three challenges
    relevant to the area of personal informatics: determining context, assumptions
    around "personal" use, and the social implications of representation.'

  title: Personal Informatics for Reflection on Personal Values
  abstract: In this paper we advocate the use of personal informatics systems for
    self-reflection on personal values. We describe the role values play as guiding
    principles in people’s lives. We then describe Value- Sensitive Design, an approach
    to the design of technology that aims to account for values throughout the design
    process. We subsequently argue that personal informatics, in its focus on self-reflection,
    is well-suited as a means for discovering and understanding personal values, which
    can then be used as a starting point for Value-Sensitive Design. Finally, we provide
    a preliminary description of a mobile application we will implement that will
    support reflection on personal values.

  title: 'A Mobile Application for Improving Health Attitudes: Being Social Matters'
  abstract: This paper describes a pilot test of a mobile phone application, VERA,
    (Virtual Environments to Raise Awareness) designed to improve attitudes about
    health by increasing awareness of health behaviors through use of a photolog.
    VERA was tested in a group and individual setting over the course of 2 weeks.
    Quantitative and qualitative data were collected. Participants in the group condition
    rated themselves as more aware of health behaviors and having more self- control
    after using the system. These results are discussed using a social psychological
    theory of self- perception and public commitment.

  title: Integrated model for multifaceted behavior change
  abstract: In this paper we describe an integrated model for supporting multifaceted
    behavior change. We propose to combine information used to inform a current behavior
    with information to motivate a relevant new behavior. Towards this goal, we propose
    a model composed of the transtheoretical model, the theory of planned behavior
    and the stage-based model of personal informatics to design multifaceted systems.

  title: Sentiment Analysis on Personal Email Archives
  abstract: A significant portion of a user’s digital past is recorded in the form
    of email messages, SMS texts, tweets, status up- dates and blog posts. We view
    this personal text archive as a personal informatics system that captures deep
    and meaningful information for the user. However, it is a challenge to efficiently
    browse and extract useful infor- mation from an unstructured text corpus spanning
    tens of thousands of entries accumulated over many years. We propose the use of
    sentiment analysis techniques on users’ personal text archives to aid in the task
    of per- sonal reflection and analysis . We have built and publicly released a
    system called Muse that processes an email archive, and slices it across different
    sentiment facets, such as those expressing various emotions, congratula- tory
    messages, and messages related to family matters, religion, and health. These
    slices are used for visualizing the archive and as entry point into browsing the
    actual messages. We describe some early experiences with this system.

  title: 'A Case Study of BSUED: Behavioral Science-informed User Experience Design'
  abstract: The skyrocketing costs of healthcare, the obesity epidemic, and the rapid
    ageing of the global population collectively create a critical need for evidence-based
    strategies for promoting health and wellness. Smartphone apps offer new opportunities
    for promoting health but despite the promise of these apps, most lack an evidence-informed,
    theoretical rationale underlying the methods for behavior change. The MILES (Mobile
    Interventions for Lifestyle Exercise at Stanford) group is developing three theoretically-based
    applications that use different motivational frames for promoting behavior change
    and health. In this paper, we will discuss our behavioral science-informed user
    design (or BSUED) process.

  title: 'Designing Personal Informatics Designers: Creating a Graduate Course in
    Personal Informatics'
  abstract: In this position paper, I describe the design of a graduate-level course
    in user-experience and interaction design for personal informatics applications.
    This master’s level course was taught in Winter 2011 at the University of Michigan
    School of Information in order to introduce students interested in designing personal
    informatics tools to a variety of interdisciplinary design challenges inherent
    in personal informatics applications, including measurement theory, methods, models
    of behavior change, game dynamics, visualization and ethics.

  title: 'Personal Health Informatics: What is the role for online social networks?'
  abstract: Personal health informatics can be a key mechanism to allow individuals
    to visualize and track health behavior. Providing visibility and feedback of one’s
    diet and activity level is one way to motivate positive health behavior change.
    In our survey reported here, we note that personal health information such as
    nutritional intake and activity level are not being stored consistently by people
    either offline or online. We also report on the findings from our follow up interviews
    that indicate the importance of social influences on health behavior. They suggest
    that the use of online social networks may be helpful to facilitate health behavior
    change. However, challenges such as individual privacy concerns and the difficulty
    in entering consistent and accurate health information need to be overcome before
    social networks can be used to store personal health information.

  title: 'Lullaby: Environmental Sensing'
  abstract: 'We are developing a system to help users improve the quality of their
    sleep by monitoring environmental factors that disrupt sleep and providing feedback.
    This system, called Lullaby, has several design goals. Lul- laby’s sensor suite
    should be practical for deployment into bedrooms: it must be unobtrusive, inexpensive,
    and respect users’ privacy in this sensitive context. Lullaby should identify
    relationships between sleep disruptions and environmental factors and reflect
    those back to the user. Finally, Lullaby should provide con- crete recommendations
    for addressing the identified sleep disruptors. In this paper, we describe the
    design of Lullaby’s sensor suite and user interface, and how it will support personal
    use in the home.'

  title: 'Your personal brand: itʼs not just you'
  abstract: 'Brand identity is relevant not just for companies, but also for individuals.
    Some advocate complex strategies for personal brand creation, but we assert that
    social network interactions in Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter implicitly define
    a personal brand. We posit that the chain of people and entities with whom the
    individual interacts both explicitly and implicitly as well as the topics of those
    interactions is core to three facets of personal brands: actual, targeted, and
    perceived. Analysis and refinement of personal information generated in network
    relations can quickly create a personal brand. This paper presents an experiment
    to explore our position.'

  title: 'Relapse Prevention: Personal Informatics for Clinical Mental Health'
  abstract: 'Recent years has seen an increase in the development of tools to support
    reflection and increase self- awareness. However, despite the apparent relevance
    of these technologies to helping people with serious mental health problems in
    clinical settings, there has been little work to date. Bipolar Disorder is a serious
    clinical mental disorder typified by a cycle between highs and lows. It requires
    life-long management involving careful monitoring of personal symptoms and activities.
    Signal events, warning signs that a relapse is about to occur, if reported can
    help prevent relapse. Typically, this information is not reported. The goal of
    this project is to develop a tool to help individuals, their families and therapists
    identify life patterns that can lead to relapse in order to prevent it. This tool
    will involve 3 main sources of information: self-recorded data, sensor information
    and soft-sensors and data from the person''s social group. There is considerable
    potential for the well considered application of existing monitoring technologies
    to provide effective and relatively low-cost supports to individuals with serious
    mental health disorders.'

  title: Experience Sampling as Personal Informatics Tools for Persuasion
  abstract: In this position paper we propose the use of experience sampling and
    contextual diary tools as personal information applications to foster attitude
    and behavior change among individuals. Over the last years a diversity of these
    tools have been proposed in academics to research user behavior and user experience
    in-situ. We suggest utilizing these tools to help people collect personal information
    and trigger desired behavior changes. We present the Maestro approach, a concept
    to collect context data and study user behavior in realistic environments by using
    client- server architecture.

  title: Calming Technologies
  abstract: Calming technologies are interactive systems that help users maintain
    optimal cognitive, physiological, and emotional resting state even while they
    performing tasks. We attribute the emergence of calming technologies to the widely
    acknowledged benefits of stress- and anxiety-reduction in physical health, productivity,
    and performance. We describe observed approaches to calming technologies and motivate
    researchers of personal informatics to consider how their work aligns or is at
    odds with the goals of calming. Personal informatics, persuasive systems, and
    calming technology overlap due to the prevalence of sensors and feedback in an
    attempt to influence user behavior.

  title: 'BinCam: Waste Logging for Behavioral Change'
  abstract: We present BinCam, a personal informatics system to monitor individuals’
    food waste and recycling behavior. As such, it uses an augmented kitchen bin to
    automatically capture and log an individual’s waste management activity. Each
    time the bin is used, a mobile phone installed in the inside of the lid captures
    an image of the contents and uploads it to a Facebook application. The application
    offers various visualizations of individuals’ bin usage to increase their awareness
    of the items they disposed of. Applying Facebook as a platform for reflection
    offers the potential to engage individuals to regularly use the application. In
    addition, we regard the social network of Facebook, with its communication dynamics
    and social influences, as a powerful source in changing personal attitudes and
    behavior. In this scope, the paper discusses several challenges for designing
    and evaluating persuasive personal informatics systems.
