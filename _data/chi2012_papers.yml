  title: Understanding Self-Efficacy and the Design of Personal Informatics Tools
  abstract: The design of many personal informatics tools or approaches for behavior
    change can be influenced by Social Cognitive Theory, which suggests self-efficacy
    impacts ability to change. Self-efficacy is easy to measure and indicates adherence
    to behavioral strategies. This makes it an attractive construct for evaluation
    of PI technologies. In this workshop paper, we discuss what self-efficacy is,
    how to measure it, and three factors that impact the measurements.

  title: Deep Personalization in Tools for Reflection
  abstract: Personal informatics (PI) tools that support reflection are “personalized”
    insofar as the data consists of an individual’s data. Typically, this data is
    presented in visualizations that are generic and non-individuated. In this paper,
    we argue for deep personalization, where the visualizations are constructed by
    individuals. Such functionality gives individuals the power to build visualizations
    that are personally meaningful, allowing them to meet and address personal needs.
    We illustrate the power of this approach by considering a case study of the design
    of a multi-faceted reflection tool. Reflecting on the deep personalization of
    the design process, we propose an approach that will allow individuals to personalize
    their own visualizations.

  title: A Framework for Modelling Goals in Personal Lifelong Informatics
  abstract: Goals and goal-setting play an important role in personalinformatics
    because they link the data within personalinformatics systems to core problems
    in people’s lives.This paper presents a framework for personal informaticsbased
    on a user model representing user goals. We arecreating a domain speciﬁc ontology
    for setting lifelongwellbeing goals, and a generic ontology of attributesassociated
    with goals based on goal-setting theory. Usercontrol is the key to this framework
    as it enables users toset meaningful goals in relation to their individual abilitiesand
    create application models that link information storedin personal digital devices
    to a particular goal. Weenvisage that this novel approach will facilitate lifelongpersonal
    goal management for individual user.

  title: 'Personal Health Mashups: Mining significant observations from wellbeing
    data and context'
  abstract: There has recently been large growth in relatively inexpensive consumer
    devices that capture health and wellbeing data. However, most of these devices
    are not connected to each other and each has their own separate web portal. We
    will describe our Health Mashups system and how the data mined from multiple wellbeing
    sensors and contextual information has helped our participants learn deeper insights
    about their wellbeing and inspire positive changes in their lives which are not
    visible in traditional time-series plots.

  title: 'Using Personal Informatics to Motivate Physical Activity: Could we be Doing
    it Wrong?'
  abstract: The global level of obesity and overweight is on the increase. Personal
    informatics – tools which assist users to collect and view information on their
    behaviours and habits – could help to reverse this trend by making users more
    aware of their daily level of physical activity. Most tools available use high-complexity
    high-engagement interfaces to convey this information. We argue that simpler interfaces
    may be more suitable for users who are not highly motivated to undertake physical
    activity. We discuss our recent work in designing and evaluating such an interface.

  title: 'Spark: Visualizing Physical Activity Using Abstract, Ambient Art'
  abstract: Many consumer personal informatics tools use charts to visualize complex
    data, help people better understand their behavior, and ultimately guide them
    to change their behavior. Informative art [5] as a form of visual representation
    has not been extensively explored in displaying personal information, but it has
    the potential to provide ambient, public, non-intrusive, playful, and interactive
    feedback that could be more engaging than reflecting on static charts. In this
    workshop paper, we describe Spark, an application that visualizes physical activity
    data as information art, and propose a study evaluating the effectiveness of such
    visualizations in the realm of personal informatics.

  title: How dangerous is your life? Personalising Government Open Crime Data
  abstract: In this paper, we present Fearsquare, an application that allows people
    to engage with Government Open Data in a way that is contextualised to their own,
    individual, everyday life. The application mashes geo-located crime statistics
    with personal check-ins registered with the social media service FourSquare to
    give users a realistic representation of the levels of crime that occur in the
    places that they frequent or visit. The application is presented as an example
    of how Open Data can be given individual context and tailored for used in the
    field of personal informatics, as well as an example of how social media can be
    used to stimulate engagement with, as well as facilitate access and add value
    to, such data.

  title: How to Design Persuasive Health Technologies for Adolescents with Chronic
    Illness?
  abstract: In this workshop, we will share our experience of working with individuals
    with asthma and diabetes as well as their caregivers. In our work we have focused
    on understanding how to improve both the physiological and psychological aspect
    of disease outcomes. The goal is to discuss the role that persuasive health technologies
    can have in improving the adherence and self-monitoring of adolescents battling
    these diseases.

  title: 'Beyond Experience Sampling: Evaluating Personal Informatics with Technology-Assisted
    Reconstruction'
  abstract: Experience Sampling has been considered the golden standard of in-situ
    measurement, yet, at the expense of high burden to participants. In this paper
    we propose Technology-Assisted Reconstruction (TAR), a methodological approach
    that combines passive logging of users’ behaviors with use of these data in assisting
    the reconstruction of behaviors and experiences. Through a number of recent and
    ongoing projects we will discuss how TAR may be employed for the evaluation of
    personal informatics systems, but also, conversely, how ideas from the field of
    personal informatics may contribute towards the development of new methodologies
    for in-situ evaluation.

  title: 'Lullaby: Capturing the Unconscious in the Sleep Environment'
  abstract: Research has shown that environmental factors can be one of the major
    causes of poor sleep quality and inter-rupted sleep [8], which can contribute
    to daytime sleepiness and fatigue. In particular, a room that is too warm [11],
    has improper lighting [10], or is noisy [1] can have a negative impact on sleep.
    While some of these environmental factors are observable, others may be subtle.
    Individuals who have poor sleep quality can often have difficulty evaluating the
    cause or severity of their sleep difficulties [3]. We present preliminary re-sults
    of an ongoing study of Lullaby, a capture and ac-cess system for the sleep environment,
    and discuss some aspects of designing capture and access for un-conscious experience.

    Emotiv EEG neuroheadset interfacingwith multiple mobile devices. This personal
    informaticssystem enables minimally invasive and continuouscapturing of brain
    imaging data in natural settings. Thesystem applies an inverse Bayesian framework
    to spatiallyvisualize the activation of neural sources real-time in a 3Dbrain
    model or to visualize the power of brainwaves withinspeciﬁc frequencies. We describe
    the architecture of thesystem and discuss initial experiments.

  title: Personal informatics for self-regulated learning
  abstract: We propose self-regulated learning, particularly with the use of web-based
    resources, as a new domain for personal informatics. We consider development in
    intelligent computer-based student modeling that can provide sophisticated data
    for reflection and describe a preliminary system for collecting and visualizing
    data from web resources for this purpose.

  title: Mindfulness, Reflection, and Persuasion in Personal Informatics
  abstract: A major design choice in personal informatics applications is how persuasive
    versus reflective an application will be. That is, will the system nudge people,
    unaware, toward goals a designer intends, will it help them set goals and then
    follow through on them, or will it surface data in a neutral way, allowing people
    to learn more about themselves but without a push to change or maintain their
    behavior in any way?

  title: 'Fitbit+: A behavior-based intervention system to reduce sedentary behavior'
  abstract: Self-tracking wearable devices are being used to track calorie consumption
    and physical activity, to support self-awareness and healthy behavior. These devices
    automatically capture desirable behaviors (such as walking) but do not typically
    detect unhealthy behaviors (such as sitting for a long period of time) or intervene
    in the moment to persuade users to correct these unhealthy behavior (e.g., by
    taking a break to go for a walk). There is an increasing trend for people with
    low physical activity occupations to sit for long periods of time, yet research
    suggests that lengthy sitting, independent of overall physical activity level,
    increases the risk of weight gain and mortality[4] . We aim to decrease the duration
    of sedentary bouts in the workplace by detecting when people have been inactive
    for a long time and then prompting them to do some physical activity. We present
    the design of Fitbit+, a system that realizes this strategy by leveraging Fitbit’s
    near real-time, automated step logging to detect sedentary behavior and then prompt
    users to take a walking break.

  title: Ambivalence about (Inter)Personal Informatics for Smoking Cessation
  abstract: We explore user ambivalence towards interpersonal informatics systems
    for smoking cessation. Smokers desire support through such systems to help them
    reflect on their habits and create strategies for changing them, yet at the same
    time they are reluctant to share personal information via these systems. We conducted
    interviews with smokers and recent ex-smokers to discuss their current practices
    to quit smoking and to evaluate a prototypical smoking cessation application.
    We discuss the different facets of their ambivalence towards collecting, sharing,
    and reflecting on personal information via interpersonal informatics systems.
    We close with a summary of the main challenges emerging from such ambivalence
    and potential directions to address them.

  title: ECO|Balance – Exploring Design Issues for Mobile Persuasion
  abstract: 'Engaging people to regularly reflect on their own behavior is a crucial
    step towards changing it for the better. In this paper we present ECO|Balance,
    a set of interactive design metaphors for mobile devices that aim towards enticing
    continued engagement through using visual appeal and avoiding factors that chastise.
    As a bridge between data visualization and information art the idea is to keep
    people interested in repeatedly working with and analyzing their data. We chose
    the scenario of personal mobility and reducing one’s carbon footprint and created
    a series of four animated designs: Pie Flow, Jelly Fish, Footprints and Organic
    Flowers that explore different approaches to representation and interaction. We
    discuss our main goals of long-term enticement through visual appeal and subtlety.'

  title: Digital Histories for Future Health
  abstract: In this paper we describe the opportunity for digital behavioral histories
    to empower individuals to engage in positive health behaviors. The digital trails
    we leave by using various social, mobile and web services and self-tracking tools
    can be used to create a compelling digital narrative of past behaviors. The use
    of these digital narratives should be explored for the purpose of facilitating
    self-efficacy and positively re-framing health behaviors. We first describe the
    digital environment that supports our concept of digital histories. We then explore
    the current methods being employed by health services. Lastly, we explain the
    theoretical value of digital narratives and give examples of possible implementation
    strategies that could be used to influence health behaviors.

  title: Thinking about Side Effects of Personal Informatics Systems
  abstract: In this paper we discuss how Personal Informatics systems that aggregate
    and display data back to users can have unintended side effects. Based on three
    examples from our prior work, we see that these side effects can be negative and
    vary from discouraging use of the system to creating tunnel vision where users
    bias parts of their experience over others. However in some cases these side effects
    are not negative, just unexpected. Regardless of their valence, it is important
    to consider the possibilities of these side effects when designing and evaluating
    personal informatics systems, and we present a few strategies for being attentive
    to these effects early on.

  abstract: We are developing Hydrostream, a server-based platform for the collection,
    visualization, annotation and analysis of water pressure in a home setting. While
    designed with health applications in mind, Hydrostream can be easily applied towards
    more general-purpose personal informatics applications. In this paper we describe
    the system in detail, present motivating design goals and discuss challenges and
    opportunities.
