    The Lap Track fits on most all pool decks as there are various ways of which the unit can be mounted. Included with the packaging is all the necessary set-up equipment: 2 pairs of suction cups (for different sizes tiles), an attachable platform with extenders for use in pools that aren't tiled, and a carrying bag that doubles as a water weight to stabilize the base of the extenders. The Lap Track comes ready-to-use with 2 AAA batteries and no need for additional operating equipment purchases.

  description: |-
    The Graffito Data Project is a new concept about looking at what a credit card statement can be beyond just a bill.
    We think credit card statements conveniently provide two ingredients to start telling a good story - time and place.
    So we've started building a platform to let people collect, organize and share those compelling stories that may have otherwise been forgotten.

  slogan: Tracks your progress toward your goals
  description: |-
    Kibotzer tracks your progress toward your goals. Anything you can put a periodic number on works -- weight, pushups, number of cigarettes, net worth, or how long it takes you to bike to work. Just answer with your number when kibotzer asks and it will show you your progress and a "yellow brick road" to follow to stay on track.

    A big selling point for kibotzer is the data smoothing. With weight loss, for example, it's discouraging and/or nerve-wracking to see the numbers bounce around day-to-day which is why weight-loss programs typically only ask for weekly weigh-ins. But if you have a random up day on a weekly weigh-in day, that's really discouraging. Better to get more data and let kibotzer show you the true trend. And you get daily instead of weekly feedback. That's key.

Still others focused on both nutrition and exercise but had no support forums, and were again telling you exactly what to do. And with some you would have to answer many questions before you could even find out how much they charge. Almost all didn't focus on self-improvement.

  slogan: Visualizing Last.fm Listening Histories and Personal Streams
  description: |-
    LastHistory allows you to analyze music listening histories from Last.fm through an interactive visualization and to explore your own past by combining the music you listened to with your own photos and calendar entries. It is written as a desktop application for Mac OS X v10.5 or higher.

    LastHistory can be used in one of two modes, each of which is optimized for a different use case:

    * *Analysis Mode*
    This mode can be used for interactively analyzing an arbitrary listening history (not necessarily your own) in three basic dimensions: time, tracks and genre. Integrated tools like searching, playlist highlighting, mouse-over information, and zooming allow to generate insight for the visualized music listening history in each of those dimensions.
    * *Personal Mode*
    This mode adapts the visualization shown in Analysis mode for exploring your own past: by adding photos from your iPhoto library and calendar entries from iCal to the visualization, you can reminisce about your past by listening to the top tracks from your last vacation while watching a slide show of the corresponding photos. Or you can find the most influential tracks that you listened to most during a specific timeframe by inspecting the highlighted tracks in the visualization.

  slogan: Analyze your sleep pattern
  description: |-
    The Sleep Cycle alarm clock is a bio-alarm clock that analyzes your sleep patterns and wakes you when you are in the lightest sleep phase.

    Waking up in the lightest sleep phase feels like waking without an alarm clock - it is a natural way to wake up where you feel rested and relaxed.

    Sleep Cycle has become a huge success with a #1 paid app position in many countries, including Germany, Japan and Russia.

    Since you move differently in bed during the different phases, Sleep Cycle uses the accelerometer in your iPhone to monitor your movement to determine which sleep phase you are in.

    Health Month is a new social game about taking the SCIENCE of nutrition and behavior change and combining it with the SOCIAL GAMES of the recent social web to help people improve their health habits in a fun and sustainable way.

    The formula for living healthier has 4 incredients:
    1) The information (most people have this, and we can help fill gaps)
    2) The ability (most people have this too)
    3) The motivation (who doesn't want to be healthier, at least a little bit, right?)
    4) The fun and sustainable trigger. The reason. The self-challenge. The game.

    The game that helps you live healthy, not because you have to, but because it's fun. Fun simply motivates more than guilt, and the end result is the same.

  description: |-
    Mappiness is a free app for your iPhone. It's part of a research project at the London School of Economics. We'd love to have you on board!

    *How does it work?*

    You get Mappiness from the App Store, open it, and sign up.

    We beep you once (or more) a day to ask how you're feeling, and a few basic things to control for: who you're with, where you are, what you're doing (if you're outdoors, you can also take a photo).

    The data gets sent back â€” anonymously and securely â€” to our data store, along with your approximate location from the iPhone's GPS, and a noise-level measure.

    *What's in it for you?*

    Interesting information about your own happiness, which you can download or see charted inside the app â€” including when, where and with whom you're happiest.

    The warm glow of helping increase the sum of human knowledge.

    *What's in it for us?*

    We're particularly interested in how people's happiness is affected by their local environment â€” air pollution, noise, green spaces, and so on â€” which the data from Mappiness will be absolutely great for investigating.

    Saving money is tough enough--but tracking it until now has been impossible. FoundMoney is here to help!

    With FoundMoney, you can quickly and easily add in what you've done to save money and how much you've saved. Then, our app tracks the amount you've saved in a running total, so you can see how much your small changes ($2 here, $10 there) have added up.


    The next time you're at that store or restaurant, you can execute the same savings transaction with a single swipe. It's easy!

    Plus -- you can see what <b>other </b>users have done to save money. See an idea you like or haven't thought of? Track it and do it the next time you're out.

    Before you know it, you'll be saving hundreds of dollars a month. Whether that becomes a tropical vacation, a home remodel or a college savings is up to you.

    FoundMoney makes saving money and tracking your savings fun and easy!
