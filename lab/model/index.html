<p>
  This is a model of personal informatics systems 
  that we hope would be valuable for research and development.
  It provides a common framework for describing, comparing, and evaluating
  the growing number of this class of systems.
  This model is composed of five stages
  (<i>preparation</i>, <i>collection</i>, <i>integration</i>, <i>reflection</i>, and <i>action</i>).
  These stages have four properties: 
  barriers cascade to later stages;
  they are iterative;
  they are user-driven and/or system-driven;
  and they are uni-faceted or multi-faceted.
  From these properties, we recommend that personal informatics systems should
  1) be designed in a holistic manner across stages;
  2) allow iteration between stages;
  3) apply an appropriate balance of automated technology and user control
  within each stage to facilitate the user experience; and
  4) explore support for associating multiple facets of people's lives
  to enrich the value of systems.
