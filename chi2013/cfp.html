<h2>Call for Participation</h2>
<p>
  Knowing oneself has many benefits, including improving learning,
  increasing self-control, and promoting positive behaviors.
  A new class of applications called personal informatics is appearing
  that help people learn more about their selves, their behaviors, and their habits.
  This workshop will bring together researchers in a wide range of disciplines
  to discuss challenges and explore opportunities for human-computer interaction in the growing field of personal informatics.
</p>
<p>
  <b>This is a 2-day workshop.</b>
  On the first day, participants will split into groups to work together on prototypes.
  On the same day, we will test and play with these prototypes with a short tour of Paris.
  On the second day, we will follow the format we have used in the past 3 years:
  1) short presentations, 2) group sessions, and 3) plenty of breaks to converse one-on-one with other participants.
  There will also be a planned meeting with members of the Paris branch of the Quantified Self.
</p>
<p>
  We will discuss technical and design issues related
  to monitoring and feedback of personal behavioral information.
  We will discuss different behavioral theories to guide the development
  of personal informatics systems, and the social implications of self-tracking.
  We will discuss how to apply lessons learned from past research and existing products
  on various application domains relevant to improving quality of life,
  such as fitness, nutrition, wellness, mental health, and sustainability.
  Key research areas include: ubiquitous computing, life logging, visualizations,
  persuasive technologies, interaction design, psychology of self-knowledge and self-awareness.
</p>
<p>
  We invite technologists, designers, and behavioral scientists working
  on topics related to personal informatics.
  Submit a position paper (2 to 4 pages) in the <a href="http://chi2013.acm.org/authors/format/#extendedformat">ACM Extended Abstracts format</a>
  about your ongoing work, recent results, study methods, or perspectives on personal informatics.
  Papers will be peer-reviewed and 15-20 participants will be selected by relevance and likelihood
  of stimulating and contributing to this discussion.
