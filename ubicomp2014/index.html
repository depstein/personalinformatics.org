<h2>Call for Participation</h2>

<p>
  Though never a desirable outcome, failure is an inevitable part of research. Too often, however, the tried but failed
  paths are lost in the translation of work to publication. With the pragmatics of publishing (e.g., page limits) and the
  academic emphasis on positive outcomes, failed processes, methodologies, study designs, and technologies are
  frequently not disclosed. This is a missed opportunity, particularly for nascent but growing research areas in
  HCI/UbiComp that require high costs in time, development, and recruitment for building and deploying testable
  systems. Our workshop focuses on one such area, in particular, the rapidly growing field of Personal Informatics (PI)
  or Quantified Self (QS).
</p>
<p>
  In this workshop, our goal is to uncover, analyze, discuss, and learn from the failures of PI and QS research—failures
  that are most often not captured or surfaced in traditional publications because of embarrassment, perceived
  irrelevance, or simply lack of space. We want to provide an explicit forum to share stories of failure, perhaps even
  entire lines of research that did not succeed, in order to synthesize lessons learned and help progress the PI research
  community forward. We aim to bring PI researchers together in an environment where sharing mistakes and stories
  of failure is encouraged. We feel that many researchers—including ourselves—would greatly benefit from a solid set
  of practical, community-harvested guidelines and methodologies for conducting PI research in light of the challenges
  in this space. New PI researchers would particularly benefit from the surfacing of this institutionalized knowledge, as
  detours caused by repeating previous researchers’ mistakes can delay a project on the order of months or years
  without meaningfully advancing research goals.

<h3>Topics of Interest</h3>

<p>
  We invite participants from a broad range of disciplines, including technologists, behavioral scientists, designers, and
  artists to submit papers describing their PI-related disasters, a retrospective analysis of what went wrong and why,
  and a synthesis of lessons learned. We invite contributions on topics associated with research failure points,
  including but not limited to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>User Study Design:</b> How decisions affecting the design of studies proved to be flawed, affected the validity of
    results, led to biases, or constrained findings.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Privacy and Security:</b> Approaches that could threaten the privacy of individuals or expose study participants
    to harm or discomfort.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Field Deployment:</b> Undesirable issues that emerged only in real-life deployments and could not be anticipated.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Hardware and Software:</b> The role that hardware and software platform choices played in failed experiments
    (e.g., open vs. proprietary, custom vs. off-the-shelf, web, mobile, desktop, wearables, sensors)
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Data Collection:</b> How different approaches for data collection could compromise the data (e.g., in case of
  hardware failure).
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Methods and Techniques:</b> Misuse of tools and instruments, such as poorly produced surveys and experience
    sampling abuse.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>User Interfaces:</b> How UI design influenced findings, proved to be an obstacle in terms of user experience,
    provided misguided feedback or steered participants away from the task at hand.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>APIs:</b> Issues around querying user data through third-party APIs, both in terms of technical approaches that
    proved limiting/unsuccessful or that violated terms of service agreements.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Workshop Format</h3>

<p>
  The one-day workshop day will be split between rapid, five-minute “workshop madness” talks summarizing the
  authors’ workshop papers, small-group breakout discussions, and full-group presentations that distill and summarize
  the breakout sessions. The morning session will be dedicated to the topic of “failures”, and the afternoon will be
  focused on “lessons learned”. We will conclude with a 45-minute synthesis and all-group discussion.
</p>

<h3>Paper Submissions</h3>
<p>
  Submitted papers must be 2–4 pages in the
  <a href="http://www.sigchi.org/publications/chipubform">
    SIGCHI Extended Abstract format
  </a>
  (<a href="http://www.sigchi.org/publications/chipubform/sigchi-extended-abstracts-word-template/view">Word</a>
  or <a href="http://www.sigchi.org/publications/chipubform/sigchi-extended-abstracts-latex-template/view">LaTeX</a>).
  Papers will be
  reviewed by the committee based on their topic relevance, exposition, and potential to provoke thoughtful
  discussion. Each paper will receive at least two independent reviews. Accepted papers will be published in the
  UbiComp 2014 adjunct proceedings.
</p>
<p>
  Please send submissions to <a href="mailto:ethomaz@gatech.edu">ethomaz@gatech.edu</a> by 5:00PM PDT.
