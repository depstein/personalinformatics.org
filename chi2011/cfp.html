section: workshops

<h2>Call for Participation</h2>
<p>
	Personal informatics is a class of systems that help people understand their behaviors, habits, and thoughts.
	Developing such systems poses new challenges in human-computer interaction
	and creates opportunities for collaboration between diverse disciplines,
	including design, ubiquitous computing, persuasive technology and information visualization.
	This workshop will continue the conversation from the <a href="/chi2010/">CHI 2010 workshop</a>
	and extend the discussion of personal informatics
	to include behavioral theories that can guide the development of such systems,
	as well as the social implications of self-tracking.
</p>

<p>
	The workshop will be organized in three major areas:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Challenges in developing personal informatics systems.
	<li>
		Behavioral theories to guide the development of personal informatics systems,
		such as self-regulation and goal setting.
	</li>
	<li>
		Social implications of self-tracking.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	We invite technologists, designers, and behavioral scientists working on topics related to personal informatics.
	Submit a position paper (2 to 4 pages) in the <a href="http://www.chi2011.org/authors/format.html#extendedformat">ACM Extended Abstracts format</a>
	about your ongoing work, recent results, study methods, or perspectives on personal informatics.
	Papers will be peer-reviewed and 15-20 will be selected by relevance and likelihood of stimulating and contributing to this discussion.
	Email your paper in PDF format to <a href="mailto:ianli@cmu.edu">ianli@cmu.edu</a>
	with subject "CHI 2011 Workshop Submission"
	by February 11, 2011.
</p>
<p>
	Note: At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the workshop
	and for one or more days of the CHI conference.
