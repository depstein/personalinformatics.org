<h2>Call for Participation</h2>
<p>
	People strive to know themselves more by collecting information
	about their behaviors, habits, and thoughts.
	A growing class of applications called personal informatics is appearing
	that facilitates the collection of personal information and the reflection
	on that information.
	These systems satisfy people's innate curiosity about themselves
	and encourage holistic engagement with one's life.
</p>
<p>
	This workshop will bring together researchers in a wide range of disciplines to discuss challenges and explore opportunities for human-computer interaction in the growing field of personal informatics. We will discuss technical and design issues related to collecting and reflecting on personal information. We will discuss the benefits of reflecting on information about different facets of one's life, such as increased self-awareness, holistic engagement with life, and achievement of life balance. Key research areas include: ubiquitous computing, life logging, visualizations, persuasive technologies, interaction design, psychology of self-knowledge and self-awareness.
</p>
<p>
	We invite technologists, designers, and behavioral scientists working on topics related to personal informatics.
	Submit a position paper (2 to 4 pages) in the <a href="http://www.chi2010.org/authors/format.html#extendedformat">ACM Extended Abstracts format</a>
	about your ongoing work, recent results, study methods, or perspectives on personal informatics.
	Papers will be peer-reviewed and 10-15 selected by relevance and likelihood of stimulating and contributing to this discussion.
	Email your paper in PDF format to <a href="mailto:ianli@cmu.edu">ianli@cmu.edu</a>
	with subject "CHI 2010 Workshop Submission"
	by January 6, 2010.
</p>
<p>
	Note: At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the workshop
	and for one or more days of the CHI conference.
